Encapsulation -  is when you hide stuff in your objects from the public. The public 
would be considered outside the object. Variables or methods private
and protected. I like to refer to encapsulation as security.

Inheritance - one parent passes on methods that the children inherit. 

Interfaces - specifies methods that must be used by the class. Interfaces 
are defined like classes, but with the interface keyword replaces the class keyword. 

Polymorphism - describes a pattern in object oriented programming in which classes 
have different functionality while sharing a common interface.

Characters // basic class services as a bank for all the powers a character 
           // will have
 - Hp
 - ArmorVaule 
 - MagicPower

//diferrent types of characters but they all have thing in common
//atrrtibetes that are applied to all of these creators

Wolf extends Characters// child of character so they are going to inherit all the poperties
Horse extends Characters // child of character so they are going to inherit all the poperties
Dragon extends Characters // child of character so they are going to inherit all the poperties
Human extends Characters // child of character so they are going to inherit all the poperties
